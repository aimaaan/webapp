    <p>Located in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia. As you might have guessed from its name, the Crystal Mosque, also known as Masjid Kristal, is not made of crystal. In actuality, it is comprised of steel and glass. It appears to be composed of crystal because of the various angles at which the sun's rays are reflected by it. This mosque has no windows and was constructed using elements of Moorish architecture. There are 15 doors instead, and each one is decorated with distinctive Khat inscriptions.This mosque, which is the first smart mosque in Malaysia, is a component of the Islamic Heritage Park on Wan Man Island. Visitors can access the free Wi-Fi for internet access and to read the electronic Al-Quran.This mosque is among the most beautiful in Malaysia because at night, when multicoloured LED lights shine on it, it displays a distinct aspect of beauty. </p>

    <p>Located in Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On October 25, 2000, the Federal Territory Mosque, also known as Masjid Wilayah Persekutuan, opened to the public. It has four levels and houses a daycare, a multipurpose hall, male and female dorms, a seminar room, and many other amenities. The Blue Mosque in Istanbul is thought to resemble this mosque. The Federal Territory Mosque has a floating aspect because it was constructed on a man-made lake. The Federal Territory Mosque was built with the idea of a "Mosque in the Garden," but it also heavily draws design cues from Ottoman and Malay architecture. The Laman Hidayah is one of this mosque's most appealing features.</p>

A few years later, the complex's campus for Al-Bukhary International University was added. This mosque, which is situated next to a paddy field, has a sizable fountain in the middle. The courtyard's turquoise pools provide a tranquil scene. Many of the architectural elements in this mosque were modelled after those found in mosques in the Middle East, such as the main dome and the minarets, which were influenced by the Abbasi Great Mosque and Al-Masjid a Nabawi, respectively. Even the minbar was modelled after the one in the 1400s-built Mosque of Qaitbay. It has become a popular photo location for Muslims and non-Muslims alike because it is one of Malaysia's most stunning mosques.</p>

This mosque was constructed in 1912 with an opulent architecture and was finished in 1915. It nonetheless continues to operate as Kedah's official state mosque.Here is also where the yearly Qur'an-reading contest for the state is conducted. This mosque might be recognisable to some people. This is due to the Azizi Mosque in the Langkat Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia, which was thought to be the largest mosque in the Malay archipelago at the time, having a significant effect on Masjid Zahir's construction.

    <p>Located in Jalan Perdana, Tasik Perdana, Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur. The national mosque we see today does not resemble the mosque it once did. A significant refurbishment in 1987 produced the current appearance. The mosque changed from having a pink concrete roof to having a greenish-blue roof after that. In actuality, what distinguishes it from other mosques is the distinctive design of the roof. The roof of the mosque was fashioned to resemble an open umbrella, while the rocket-shaped minaret assumed the form of a closed umbrella. It has a contemporary appearance with elements of Ottoman and Abbasid architecture.</p>
